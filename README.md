# A-Lang

This is my first crack at a programming language. This will include lots of plans..

## Syntax

Logical Operators
- and
- or
- not

Bitwise Operators
- & = and
- | = or
- ^ = xor
- ! = not
- << = left shift (x2)
- >> = right shift (/2)

Keywords
- continue
- break
- return

Types
- int
- double
- string
- char

Each type will have an array and pointer version. I am not sure how strings will be handled
