# This will be the first thing I try to implament

```
main() -> {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 2;
    return x + y;
}
```

This is an EXTREMELY basic example but it should allow me to kinda learn wtf ocamllex is and how that should work. It will also give me some detail into how variables and types work. Maybe ill add strings to this as well...

Who really knows at this point but I think this is a good place to start for now.

Also, this code is pretty much exactly rust. I know that.
